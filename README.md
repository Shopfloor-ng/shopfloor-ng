# Shopfloor-NG

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.3.

Please note that this software is still under heavy development. **Nothing** is expected to work.

## What it does

Shopfloor-NG is supposed to be an open source implementation to help implement functional structure on the industrial environments. This will be possible thanks to the subdivision of **epics** with **modules** and **steps**.

Furthermore, open API endpoints will ensure interoperability with any other external system that can do REST calls.

Opensource means that you will be able to also implement your own functions and APIs based on specific necesseties.
